# 🚀 100-Days-of-Code: Python & AI Engineering

This repository is a comprehensive 100-day technical sprint dedicated to mastering Python, system architecture, and frontier AI integration. My goal is to bridge the gap between academic Computer Science theory and production-grade engineering.


## 🗺 Detailed Roadmap

### 🧱 Phase 1: Python Foundations & Data Structures (Days 1-25)
*Focus: Mastering the core logic and ASU academic requirements.*
- **Days 1-5:** Variables, Data Types, and Flow Control (If-Else, Loops).
- **Days 6-10:** Functions, Scope, and Error Handling (Try-Except).
- **Days 11-15:** Advanced Collections: Dictionaries and Sets for fast data access.
- **Days 16-20:** ASU Special: Linked Lists and Big O Complexity Analysis.
- **Days 21-25:** Stacks, Queues, and Recursion Logic.

### 🤖 Phase 2: OOP & Asynchronous Systems (Days 26-50)
*Focus: Building scalable and efficient software architectures.*
- **Days 26-35:** Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Inheritance, Encapsulation).
- **Days 36-40:** Advanced Python: Decorators, Magic Methods, and Generators.
- **Days 41-45:** Network Programming: API Integrations and HTTP Protocols.
- **Days 46-50:** Concurrency in Python: Mastery of `asyncio` and Multithreading.

### 🚀 Phase 3: Frontier AI & Agentic Reasoning (Days 51-75)
*Focus: Integrating LLMs and building autonomous agents.*
- **Days 51-60:** LLM Integration: OpenAI API, Prompt Engineering, and Chains.
- **Days 61-65:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Vector Databases.
- **Days 66-70:** Self-Healing Agents: Systems that test and correct their own logic.
- **Days 71-75:** AI Safety and Evaluation Frameworks.

### 🏆 Phase 4: System Design & Scalability (Days 76-100)
*Focus: Preparing for industry-standard technical interviews and deployments.*
- **Days 76-85:** Databases (SQL/NoSQL) and System Design Patterns.
- **Days 86-90:** Containerization (Docker) and Cloud Integration.
- **Days 91-95:** Advanced Algorithms: Graph Theory and Dynamic Programming.
- **Days 96-100:** Capstone AI Project and 100-Day Performance Review.
