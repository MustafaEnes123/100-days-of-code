# 🚀 100-Days-of-Code: The Fearless AI Engineering Journey

Welcome to my 100-day execution sprint. I am a 16-year-old developer currently accelerating through **Arizona State University (ASU)** Computer Science credits while building the future of autonomous systems.

This repository serves as a live technical journal of my "Fearless Era"—a period dedicated to mastering Python, frontier AI research, and high-scale automation.

## 🦅 The Mission
By May 2026, I aim to bridge the gap between academic theory and production-grade AI engineering. This journey is not just about learning syntax; it's about building **Cortex AI**, my ecosystem for agentic workflows.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python (Async, OOP, System Architecture)
* **AI & Automation:** n8n, OpenAI API, LangChain
* **Academic Focus:** Data Structures, Algorithms, Discrete Mathematics (ASU Curriculum)

## 🗺 Roadmap
- [ ] **Phase 1 (Days 1-25):** ASU Foundations & Pythonic Data Structures
- [ ] **Phase 2 (Days 26-50):** Agentic Automations & Async Systems
- [ ] **Phase 3 (Days 51-75):** Frontier AI & **Cortex Open Source Launch**
- [ ] **Phase 4 (Days 76-100):** Advanced Systems, Scalability & Residency Prep
